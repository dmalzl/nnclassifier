# nnclassifier
A simple library for building neural networks for multi-class classification. 

The code is inspired by the [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) and the code draws heavily from examples at [learningpytorch](https://www.learnpytorch.io/02_pytorch_classification/) and [machinelearningmastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/building-a-multiclass-classification-model-in-pytorch/) and is by no means complete which mainly means requirements have to be installed manually.
